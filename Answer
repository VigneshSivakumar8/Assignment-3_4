NameNode and its Importance in Hadoop Cluster :-
                       The NameNode is the centerpiece of an HDFS file system. It keeps the directory tree of all files in the file system,
               and tracks where across the cluster the file data is kept. It does not store the data of these files itself. Client
               applications talk to the NameNode whenever they wish to locate a file, or when they want to add/copy/move/delete a file. 
               The NameNode responds the successful requests by returning a list of relevant DataNode servers where the data lives. The
               NameNode is a Single Point of Failure for the HDFS Cluster. HDFS is not currently a High Availability system. When the
               NameNode goes down, the file system goes offline. There is an optional SecondaryNameNode that can be hosted on a separate
               machine. It only creates checkpoints of the namespace by merging the edits file into the fsimage file and does not provide
               any real redundancy. Hadoop 0.21+ has a BackupNameNode that is part of a plan to have an HA name service, but it needs 
               active contributions from the people who want it (i.e. you) to make it Highly Available.
                       The Name Node is a critical component of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Without it, Clients would not be able
               to write or read files from HDFS, and it would be impossible to schedule and execute Map Reduce jobs. Because of this, itâ€™s a
               good idea to equip the Name Node with a highly redundant enterprise class server configuration; dual power supplies, hot 
               swappable fans, redundant NIC connections, etc.
